Use Google's GenAI library with the Gemini-1.5-flash model 

## Code Explanation:

This code snippet demonstrates how to use Google's Generative AI (GenAI) library to interact with the Gemini-1.5-flash language model and get a response to a user prompt. 

**1. Import Libraries**

   - `import google.generativeai as genai`:  Imports the GenAI library, providing the tools for interacting with Google's Generative AI services.
   - `import os`: Imports the `os` module for accessing environment variables.

**2. Retrieve API Key**

   - `gemeini_api_key = os.getenv("GEMINI_API_KEY")`: Retrieves the API key for accessing Google's Generative AI services from an environment variable called "GEMINI_API_KEY". This is a common practice to keep sensitive keys out of the code itself.

**3. Configure GenAI**

   - `genai.configure(api_key=os.environ["GEMINI_API_KEY"])`: Configures the GenAI library using the retrieved API key. This establishes a connection between your code and Google's AI services.

**4. Create a Generative Model Object**

   - `model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")`:  Creates an instance of the `GenerativeModel` class representing the Gemini-1.5-flash language model. This is the model you'll be interacting with.

**5. Generate Content**

   - `response = model.generate_content("What is Gemini API")`:  Sends the prompt "What is Gemini API" to the Gemini-1.5-flash model. The `generate_content` method interacts with the model and processes the prompt to generate a response.

**6. Print the Response**

   - `print(response.text)`: Prints the generated text from the `response` to the console, which will be the Gemini model's answer to the prompt.

**In Summary:**

This code demonstrates a basic example of using Google's GenAI library with the Gemini-1.5-flash model. It retrieves the API key, configures the GenAI library, selects the Gemini model, sends a prompt, and displays the model's response. This code serves as a foundation for more complex interactions with the Gemini model for tasks like text generation, translation, summarization, and more.
